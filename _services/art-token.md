# Introduction

Computational services for generative art exhibitions involve the use of advanced technology and computational methods to create and display art that is constantly evolving and changing. This type of art is created using algorithms that can be programmed to respond to various inputs or data sets. By integrating data provisioning, generative art can incorporate real-world data sets such as weather patterns, stock market fluctuations, or social media activity. This enables generative art to create unique and innovative pieces that are never the same and to visualize complex data in an artistic form. The possibilities are endless with computational generative art, ranging from 2D and 3D renders to AI-generated artwork. Our computational services team has expertise in utilizing neural networks, developing complex algorithms, and rendering high-quality pieces. This type of service is essential for organizations and artists looking to push the boundaries of traditional art and create immersive and interactive experiences for their audiences.

## Data integration

Real-life data can be used for generative art by integrating it as an input source for algorithms, allowing the artwork to be influenced by real-time events or datasets. This can result in unique and constantly evolving pieces of art.

Our computational services team has the expertise to find solutions to connect data providers with generative art. We can work with a wide range of data sources and formats, providing potential clients with flexibility and versatility for their generative art projects. Some examples of the types of data sources and formats we can work with include:

1. Public and private APIs: We can connect to various APIs, such as weather, financial market data, social media, or any other data provider offering an API to access their data.
2. Databases: We can work with different databases, such as SQL, NoSQL, or graph databases, to extract and process data for generative art projects.
3. CSV, JSON, XML, and other file formats: We can process data stored in common file formats like CSV, JSON, or XML, allowing for a seamless integration of data from diverse sources.
4. Web scraping: We can extract data from websites through web scraping techniques, which can then be used as input for generative art algorithms.
5. Real-time data streams: We have the ability to work with real-time data streams, such as IoT sensors, social media feeds, or any other data source providing a continuous flow of information.

By understanding the data structure and format, our team can develop custom algorithms that can ingest and interpret the data in real-time. This allows us to create generative art that is responsive to the data inputs, resulting in innovative and engaging visualizations that captivate audiences and showcase the potential of data-driven art.

## Algorithm development

Algorithm development is the process of creating a set of instructions or rules that a computer can follow to solve a specific problem or accomplish a specific task. In the context of generative art, algorithm development is used to create unique and innovative pieces that can respond to various inputs or data sets, producing a different outcome each time.

Algorithm development for generative art involves designing and coding mathematical rules and equations that can create visual patterns and shapes. This can be done using programming languages such as Python, Java, or Processing, among others. The process also involves testing and refining the algorithm to ensure that it is producing the desired result.
